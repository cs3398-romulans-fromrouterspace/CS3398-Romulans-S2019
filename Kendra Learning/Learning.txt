I learned how to add my database to pgadmin so I could see how rails was seeing who the admin was so I can modify the admin portal later.

Plan:

Add edit team button in admin portal to be able to pull teams and change members.
      1. Add option to html
      2. figure out how to pull teams from database. Maybe team.user
      3. figure out how to move users on teams
