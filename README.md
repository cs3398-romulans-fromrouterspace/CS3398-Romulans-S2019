# TeamShare
By Romulans from Router Space, CS3398.

## Welcome
We want to help you distill an abstract task (coordinating people based on skills and personality) into distinct, manageable items.  We started this probject because people and time are valuable resources.  TeamShare helps streamline both.

## Our Vision
We are a team who helps teams.  We are creating an app to simplify the work of building and scheduling teams based on skill sets and personality traits.  TeamShare is designed for simplicity and ease of use, so anyone responsible for small or large groups of people can coordinate individuals into groups.  Questionnaires about skills, experience, and personality traits are filled out by an individual, and then the team leader can organize the individuals into teams based on the results.

## Getting the code running.
To get the code running you need to have ruby on rails installed as well as a database management system (dbms) installed. These can vary based on the OS you
are using. Once everything is installed and your dbms is up and running on a localhost or server, start up the rails application and you can navigate the 
TeamShare site. Happy Sharing :)
