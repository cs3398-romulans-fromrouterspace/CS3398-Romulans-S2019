# TeamShare
- By Romulans from Router Space, CS3398.

# Welcome
- We want to help you distill an abstract task (coordinating people based on skills and personality) into distinct, manageable items.  We started this probject because people and time are valuable resources.  TeamShare helps streamline both.

# Our Vision
-  We are a team who helps teams.  We are creating an app to simplify the work of building and scheduling teams based on skill sets and personality traits.  TeamShare is designed for simplicity and ease of use, so anyone responsible for small or large groups of people can coordinate individuals into groups.  Questionnaires about skills, experience, and personality traits are filled out by an individual, and then the team leader can organize the individuals into teams based on the results.
